#Configuring your environment

1.  Install Python 2.7.3 from the python.org website
2.  Edit your environmental variables path to allow for executing python from the command line. https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html will show you how.  This essentially allows you to type "python" in the command prompt and it will open an interactive shell
3.  Install pypy (pip) from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip.  Pip is an installation manager that will help you install third party python packages.  In the case of this project, you will need ystockquote.  Once PIP is installed, you can simply type "pip install ystockquote" in to a command prompt; this will install all needed dependencies to add this to the python lib.  After installing, open a python interactive shell (type "python" on the command prompt) and then type "import ystockquote".  If you do not get an error, then it has installed correctly
4.  TBD, will let you know if it works and how to use it when I figure it the fudge out
